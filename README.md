# Webot_Maze_Solve_Robot

This is an autonomous robot designed by me for a local robotics competition, simulated using [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com) open source robot simulator. This repositiory contains completed project folder of the simulation.

Robot controller is built on subsumption architecture, written in C++. For maze solving A-star algorithm is implemented. 

Robot design is built using webot software.
